# Dark-Chess
Implements a variant of Chinese Chess using Pygame

## Introduction

Dark Resistance chess is a chess game derived from the Chinese game of Dark Chess. The game
combines elements of luck and surprise with critical strategy prevalent in conventional chess.
The game is unique in the way that strategy cannot be planned or predicted in the beginning
because strategy and movement of pieces evolve with luck and the flow of the game.

A hybrid of the two chesses – International / Indian and Chinese – this game uses all Chinese
pieces on half a conventional chess board. The pieces must have a standard backside, because
they are placed on the board in an upside-down flipped orientation, covering all grids of half a
chess board.

Please see the official handbook for detailed rules and instructions.
